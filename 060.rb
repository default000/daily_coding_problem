This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a set of integers, return whether the set can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.

For example, given the set {15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 25}, it would return true, since we can split the set up into {15, 5, 10, 15} and {20, 35}, which both add up to 55.

Given the set {15, 5, 20, 10, 35}, it would return false, since we can't split the set up into two subsets that add up to the same sum.
